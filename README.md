app-CommentBox
==============

A simple comment box that lists comments, and provides a form to enter new comments.

This is a React app, based on Facebook's React tutorial.<br/>
http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html

This app is also meant to demonstrate the use of RequireJS,<br/>
and so I've broken the React components into their own files.

REQUIRED
========

The JSX in the app modules is transformed by this RequireJS plugin:<br/>
